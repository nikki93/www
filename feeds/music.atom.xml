        I'm on a Mac now, might post about it later). It's been a while since
the &lt;a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=140560#entry986864"&gt;last
game&lt;/a&gt; I made
in it. Also seems some people are working on &lt;a href="http://enigma-dev.org/"&gt;ENIGMA&lt;/a&gt;
- a Game-Maker-to-C++ thing that also features an open source IDE. ENIGMA is
pretty interesting actually. It's fun to throw in Game Maker games and see the
weird C++ code generated after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, then I remembered Jumper/Jumper Two and Seiklus, my favourite Game
Maker games. The Jumper series is a classic hard-mode platformer thing like
Super Meat Boy, Seiklus is more of a laid back exploration-discovery game. It's
really cool and seems to have had some influence on indie platformers. In fact,
       Matt Thorson (the creator of the Jumper series) was inspired by Seiklus
       in his ''An Untitled Story.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture from Seiklus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seiklus' tunes would be stuck in my head all the time while I was playing it.
Here's some:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to get Impulse Tracker running on Mac...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
