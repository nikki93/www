Summary: list of my projects

I've been interested in programming since around 2004. Here you can find some
of my software projects (most of them being game-related). My GitHub profile is
[here](http://github.com/nikki93). The repositories at GitHub have up-to-date
code from whatever projects I put up there and you can check them out easily
with git or by downloading an archive.

### [cgame](https://github.com/nikki93/cgame)

A 2d game engine and in-game editor that allows live coding and
editing of games. The engine is written in C and supports Lua
scripting. Provides sprite rendering with animation, GUI, physics and
sound. Uses an entity-system model throughout and supports
serialization of all game data. I made the Ludum Dare 30 game
"[Reminisce](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=39848)"
using cgame.

### [GraLL 2]({filename}/pages/grall2.md)

My latest game project. Sequel to GraLL. Features Python scripting, proper
save-load mechanism, dimension system, eye candy, and more. Click on the link
above to check it out!

### [nScript]({filename}/coding/nscript-revived.md)

A interpreter written in C for a stack based language called 'nscript' I cooked
up, inspired by FORTH, Factor et al. Motivation - pure boredom. [Initial
version](http://codepad.org/au2d2pk9) was created over a weekend, but later I
got back to it and added a few more things.

### [BtOgre](http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=46856)

Integrates the Bullet physics engine and Ogre. People have found this very
useful. Someone put up a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T69dzpvku8o)
about it on YouTube and there's also an [AUR
package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/btogre-git/)!

### [GraLL](http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=34892)

My first 'large' game and my first game to have its own website. It's an
action/strategy game, where you guide a robot through 30 levels involving
bombs, explosions, doors, keys, crates and other stuff. I've released GraLL's
source code, you can find it
[here](http://s.nikhilesh.googlepages.com/grall.tar.gz).

### [NGF (nikki's Game Framework)](http://www.ogre3d.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=46398)

A a set of framework classes in C++ that help write software, especially games,
  using Ogre. Provides a game entity and level management mechanism, a
  level-loading mechanism, a Blender exporter, scripting support, and some more
  stuff. Was used in GraLL and GraLL 2.

### [nikki DotScene loader](http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/DotScene_Loader_with_User_Data)

An old little piece of code by me that helps load DotScene XML scenes into
Ogre. There's an improved version <a
href=http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/New_DotScene_Loader>here</a>.

### [Pong 3D](http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=15923)

Everyone makes a pong game at some point, eh? So, this here is my first C++
game, and my first complete 3D game too. Pong + accelerating ball + 3D = Fun!

### [Kidnapped](http://z8.invisionfree.com/Game_Maker_forum/index.php?showtopic=776)

Yet another unfinished game. My first attempt at 3D in Game Maker. A first
person shooter. This was a great experience in learning more about 3D
rendering, rasterisation, math etc.

### [Underground](http://www.rocketsoft.gm-school.uni.cc/uploads/UDemo7.zip)

An unfinished game, also one of my first. It's a platform game, about a man
stuck underground trying to get out. Made with Game Maker.

### [Space Age](http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=111964)

My first game. About spaceships, bombs and explosions. Made with Game Maker.
