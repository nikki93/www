Summary: about me

Hi! I'm Nikhilesh Sigatapu. I like to make things. I make them on the computer
because going out and making real things (like rockets) is hard. But I want to
show them to you, so I made this website too!

I'm also a music person. I play an Indian percussion instrument called the
Tabla, which I've been learning to do since 2005. So a part of this site also
contains things relating to music (soon).

Feedback is welcome.
