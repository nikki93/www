Title: cgame progress: physics, gui, in-game editor, paper, poster
Slug: cgame-progress

Summary: my independent work project

It's been a while since I [last posted about
cgame]({filename}/coding/cgame.md). I've since turned cgame into my
independent work project for college, and made a lot of progress on
it. It now has a bunch of new features including physics, GUI and an
in-game editor. You can change properties and re-write scripts with
real-time feedback while the game is running. Here's a picture:

And here's a video of me making a space shooter prototype with it in an hour:

For more information about the philosophy behind it you can check out
the [paper]({filename}/files/cgame.pdf) I wrote on it (we have to
write one for independent work projects). I also made a
[poster]({filename}/files/cgame-poster.pdf) for a poster presentation
session we had.

Also, the source code is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/nikki93/cgame).
